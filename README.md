# Project

The project was updated to react 18 by changing the render to createRoot method to utilize the new
improved react features.

Test cases for all the components.

Mobile responsive.

# Task1

Approach:

To hande all the conditions, either the array or objects was the way to solve all the scenarios.
I went with the objects as to access a value or delete value it happens in O(1) time complexity and making
it more robust when the size of grid increases.

# Task2

Approach:

The form had few values and didn't involved much dynamic form changes. So it was better to use
the html form methods for retrieving and clearing values.

The table will only shown when there are one or more than one records.
